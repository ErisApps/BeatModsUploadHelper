# BeatModsUploadHelper
Aims to make BeatMods uploads a little less painful

## Features
- Searches for previous releases of your mod and offers auto-fill of its metadata
- Updates dependencies to the latest available version
- Informs you if one or more dependencies are not yet available for the current game version

## Installation and usage
1) Install a userscript manager (browser addon) if you don't have one yet (for example [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)).
2) [Click here](https://github.com/Kevga/BeatModsUploadHelper/raw/master/BeatMods%20Upload%20Helper.user.js) to get an installation prompt by your userscript manager.
3) Open the BeatMods uploads page and type in a mod name in the respective field.
4) Click the button that appears under the name field to auto-fill its data. If the most recent upload has not been approved, a second button may appear so you have a choice which version's metadata to use. The button color indicates the approval status of the upload.
